  - The thought of sleeping with my husband makes me sick, yet I feel sick after
    sleeping with others.
  - "I like to think he knows, and he just doesn\u2019t care enough to stop me sleeping
    around."
  - "I wonder what Chad is up to tonight\u2026 maybe I could spend a few hours with
    him."
