  dialogue:
  - "Every day I sleep with at least two different men, and every day I feel more
    and more disgusting and empty. My husband doesn\u2019t even look at me, he\u2019s
    too full of himself to notice. My daughter just sits in her room all day high
    out of her mind. Neither of them hear me in the other room with sometimes up
    to three other guys in there groaning. Everytime I feel so disgusting after woulds,
    yet I can\u2019t help it. It feels so good in the moment, I feel so wanted. Although
    they may be total strangers, they seem to look after me better than my own family.
    Oh well, such is the irony of life? I\u2019d try and talk to my husband. But
    I honestly can\u2019t be bothered. It\u2019s so much easier finding guys off
    the internet that want to sleep with me than trying to have a conversation with
    him. "
