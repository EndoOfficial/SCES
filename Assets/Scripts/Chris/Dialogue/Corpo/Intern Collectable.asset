  - "28th Nov: Arnold was looking over at me funny again from inside his office.
    He came out and stumbled around with a note book and tried to tell me some brainless
    joke he cooked up about how women belong in the kitchen. Made me super uncomfortable
    but I awkwardly laughed, he seemed to look a little concerned then went back
    into his office. I hope he isn\u2019t going to fire me.  1st Oct: Arnold had
    another testing round of his shitty jokes again. This time I was by the water
    cooler chatting with Graham from accounting, Arnold came over and just said \u2018interstellar?
    I hardly know her!\u2019 and slapped me. Nobody laughed. I could see him sweating
    and he scurried off.  3rd Oct : It\u2019s so uncomfortable, not only is this
    guy basically harassing me but he does it through his jokes that are just plainly
    terrible. Rumour around the office is if you catch him on an off day and don\u2019t
    laugh at his jokes, he may fire you. Everyday I have to listen to his barrage
    of shitty jokes, every day I have to awkwardly laugh to stroke his ego and keep
    my job. It\u2019s really taking a toll on me.    Today\u2019s joke was: How many
    women does it take to change a light bulb? One! Because women are capable human
    beings. At least this one wasn\u2019t derogatory, but did he really think it
    was funny? "
