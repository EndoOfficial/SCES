  dialogue:
  - "Dear Mr Graham Dudley, \t Here is your recent shipment of THC injections to
    help ease your anxieties. I have provided approximately 60 syringes, that\u2019s
    more than double your previous dosage. Your script should renew at the same time
    next month if you wish to order more. I must warn you, I strongly suggest you
    begin seeking psychiatric help as upping your doseage of THC may lead to more
    long term side effects we have not seen and you may grow a tolerance to the medicine,
    causing it to no longer prevent you from having panic attacks. Look after yourself. 
    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDr. Terry White"
