  - "Joke 1: \tSo I was walking into the store the other day ( bring audience in
    with a story) And the refrigerator salesman comes up to me and asks how my fridge
    is running (Build up for punch line) I tell him that it\u2019s not doing too
    well and I need a new one. He told me he would be happy to help but I\u2019m
    not allowed to bring camel\u2019s inside. (Subvert audience expectations) That\u2019s
    not a camel, that\u2019s my wife! (Punch line \u2013 audience laughs)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
    Joke 2: (This should make people around the office like me more) So anyway, I
    watched that new movie the other day. (What movie? Was it interstellar?) \u2013
    audience reply Into Stella? I hardly know her!  - crossed all this out THATS
    NOT FUNNY TOO OBVIOUS  I\u2019ll never be funny, never ever. I just want people
    to like me, people like those who make them laugh, right? Why don\u2019t people
    like me. "
