  - "I\u2019ve been stuck in this wretched rural place for my whole existence. What
    a bore, there\u2019s nobody around and nothing to do. I\u2019m so alone, all
    I do is sit inside all day, with no reason to go out, nobody to go with, to talk
    to. I sit in my room, staring at a wall, lying in bed, listening to music. At
    least that is an out, but I just wish I had someone to go outside and do things
    with. There\u2019s so much \u2018know your self\u2019 bull shit these days, I
    just wish I could also know somebody else besides myself."
