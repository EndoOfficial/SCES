  - According to the latest bulletin from The Bureau, long droughts are set to occur
    for the next annual financial year, expected to leave farmers devastated. Following
    this, it is set to be flood season at the end of the droughts, expect large amounts
    of flash flooding and mass amounts of land slides covering up much needed farmland,
    thus further exacerbating the rising living costs problems alongside increasing
    rates of starvation. It is estimated that the poverty rate shall increase from
    8.5% up to 17.3% over the coming 3 financial years. Farmers are warned that if
    they are not insured, they should expect to see little to no income for the next
    half a decade.
