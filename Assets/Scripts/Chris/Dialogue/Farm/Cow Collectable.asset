  dialogue:
  - "The hands, the hands. Everytime I close my eyes all I see are those wretched,
    decrepit, old hands. Milking and milking. Twisting, pulling, pinching, at my
    woman hood. Taking away my maternal energy and all for what? For those twisted
    humanoid\u2026 things to ingest? This is meant to be for my calfs, and here they
    are, yanking it out of me just to drink it all up in their disgusting mouths.
    And they come back, morning after morning, milking and milking. With those vile,
    vile, hands."
