  - "Thank you, I apologise for my previous interactions I was\u2026 not myself.
    Starvation can do things to animals that you would not believe. I\u2019ve seen
    another cat eat its own children to survive. Those were dark days 3 weeks ago."
  - "Can you believe this, robot? This buffoon has decided to call me \u2018Bruce\u2019,
    how unflattering. My full name is Sir Pawdrid Fluffington the Third. I have a
    family name to uphold!"
  - My hunger is satiated, at last I can go back to doing what I enjoy most. A rather
    lovely napping schedule to help keep up my physique.
