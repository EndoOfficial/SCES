  - "To whom it may concern;  It has been decreed by judge Reginald Ashby that Mr
    Aaron Wires must stay a 200 ft radius away from Ms Jenifer Wires and their daughter
    Sally Wires. This is following years of alleged drug abuse causing wires to become
    unsuitable and dangerous as a parental figure. Mr Wires has been found guilty
    of child endangerment, drug abuse, domestic altercation and endangering the life
    of another. He is sentenced to three years on a good behaviour bond to be tracked
    via an anklet. During this time, he should be in for monthly psychiatric evaluations.
    At the end of this time period, he shall come back to the court for re-evaluation. 
    Signed: Reg Ashby \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDated: 05/04/2074  "
